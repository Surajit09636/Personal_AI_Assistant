Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be taking a sick leave of absence from work due to health reasons. Unfortunately, I have fallen ill and am currently unable to come to work.

My doctor has advised me to take [number] of days off to rest and recover, and I anticipate being out of the office from [start date] to [end date]. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able to return.

I have attached a doctor's note to this letter, which confirms my illness and recommends the necessary time off. If there are any pressing matters that need my attention in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
