Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be taking a sick leave due to health reasons. Unfortunately, I have fallen ill and will be unable to attend classes for the next [number of days] days.

I am currently under medical care and am expected to make a full recovery. However, I will need to take some time off to rest and recover. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any material that I miss as soon as I am able to return to class.

I have attached a doctor's note to this letter, which confirms my illness and recommends that I take the necessary time off to recover. If there is any additional documentation that you need from me, please let me know.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address].

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Note: If you are not able to attach a doctor's note, you can simply state that you are under medical care and will provide documentation if needed.

Also, be sure to customize the letter with your own details, such as your name, address, and professor's name.
