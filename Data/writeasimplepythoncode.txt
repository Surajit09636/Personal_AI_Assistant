**Simple Python Code: Hello World**
```python
# Print "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
```
This code uses the built-in `print` function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

**Explanation:**

* `print()`: A built-in Python function that prints its argument to the console.
* `"Hello, World!"`: A string literal that is passed as an argument to the `print` function.

**How to Run:**

1. Save this code in a file called `hello.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the code using `python hello.py`.

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run this code.

**Alternative: Using a Main Function**
```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code defines a `main` function that prints "Hello, World!" and uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.
